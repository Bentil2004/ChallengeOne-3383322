This project implements a basic Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure in JavaScript, with support for:

- `insert(word)`: Adds a word to the Trie.
- `search(word)`: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
- `startsWith(prefix)`: Checks if any word in the Trie starts with the given prefix.

This code also includes a sample test case that follows a typical coding challenge format.
